# PARAMSHAKTHI User Guide

# Introduction

This documentation summarizes the user manual for the PARAM SHAKTI Supercomputing facility at IIT-KGP Kharagpur. 
It covers a wide range of topics from a detailed description of the hardware information and about the basic production environment such as how-to login, information about submitting jobs, etc.
The supercomputer PARAM SHAKTI is based on a heterogeneous and hybrid configuration of Intel Xeon Skylake processors,NVIDIA Tesla V100. The system was designed and implemented by HPC Technologies team, Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC).
It consists of 2 Master nodes, 8 Login nodes, 6 Service nodes, 2 Firewall nodes , 2 Management nodes and 442 (CPU+GPU) nodes with total peak computing capacity of 1.63 (CPU+GPU) PFLOPS performance.
    


# System Architecture and Configuration

PARAM SHAKTI systems are based onIntel Xeon SKL G-6148, NVIDIA Tesla V100 with total peak performance of 1.63 PFLOPS.
 The cluster consists of compute nodes connected with Mellanox (ERD) infiniBand interconnect network.
 The system uses the Lustre parallel file system.
